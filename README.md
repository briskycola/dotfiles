### Dotfiles

This repo is meant to preserve my settings for bash and zsh along with other programs.
I use this all the time when I want to transfer my settings to another computer
or virtual machine. If you want to use these files yourself, follow the installation process.
Here is a preview of how the terminal looks like when these settings are applied.
